# Symbio AI - Distributed Patch Marketplace Integration

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The distributed patch marketplace has been successfully integrated with the existing self-healing infrastructure, creating a powerful hybrid system that combines collaborative patch sharing with automated adaptation.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Distributed Patch Marketplace** (`marketplace/patch_marketplace.py`)

   - HuggingFace Hub integration for patch storage and discovery
   - Signed patch manifests with security verification
   - Community-driven patch evaluation and rating system
   - Automated patch discovery based on failure patterns

2. **Marketplace-Integrated Healing** (`marketplace/healing_integration.py`)

   - Hybrid healing system combining marketplace patches with auto-surgery
   - Automatic patch evaluation against failure samples
   - Community contribution pipeline for successful adaptations
   - Tenant-aware patch deployment and management

3. **Enhanced Failure Monitoring** (`monitoring/failure_monitor.py`)

   - Advanced failure pattern detection and analysis
   - Context-aware failure sample extraction for healing
   - Real-time model health monitoring and recommendations
   - Integration with marketplace search and auto-surgery triggers

4. **Production Demo Application** (`main_marketplace_demo.py`)
   - FastAPI-based REST API for marketplace operations
   - Complete healing workflow endpoints
   - Real-time system monitoring and statistics
   - Multi-tenant support with policy enforcement

## üåü Key Features

### Hybrid Healing Workflow

1. **Failure Detection**: Monitor model performance and detect degradation patterns
2. **Marketplace Search**: Automatically discover relevant community patches
3. **Patch Evaluation**: Test patches against actual failure samples
4. **Deployment**: Apply best-performing patch or fallback to auto-surgery
5. **Community Contribution**: Share successful adaptations with the community
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from community collaboration

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Security-First**: Signed manifests, verified patches, multi-level security controls
- **Performance Tracking**: Delta improvements, benchmark scores, success metrics
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Isolated healing environments with policy enforcement
- **Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry and monitoring integration
- **Scalability**: Distributed architecture supporting large-scale deployments

    "task_type": "text_generation",
    "domain": "customer_service",
    "error_type": "accuracy_drop",
    "input_sample": "Customer query here",
    "expected_output": "Expected response",
    "actual_output": "Incorrect response",
    "severity": "high"
  }'
```

### Triggering Marketplace-Integrated Healing

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/healing/marketplace-integrated" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_id": "production-model-v1",
    "task_type": "text_generation",
    "domain": "customer_service",
    "max_marketplace_patches": 3,
    "min_accuracy_improvement": 0.03,
    "enable_auto_surgery": true,
    "contribute_to_marketplace": true
  }'
```

### Searching Community Patches

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/marketplace/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "accuracy improvement customer service",
    "model_id": "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
    "task_type": "text_generation",
    "domain": "customer_service",
    "max_results": 10,
    "min_score": 0.7
  }'
```
