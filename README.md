## Overview

**CausalDER** investigates causal methods for continual learning, including causal graph discovery for task relationships and interventional causality for replay buffer selection. This research systematically evaluates Pearl's causal hierarchy (Levels 1-2) applied to continual learning via the DER++ replay mechanism.

**Primary Finding:** Causal graph discovery provides interpretable task relationships with negligible performance impact (+0.07%), while both importance-weighted sampling (-2.06%) and gradient-based interventional selection (-9.4%) degrade performance relative to uniform replay baselines.

**Research Status:** Experimental validation complete (October 2025). Results include one positive finding (graph learning) and two rigorous negative results (importance sampling and interventional causality), all with clear empirical evidence and theoretical explanations.

**Code:** Public on GitHub at [github.com/ZulAmi/symbioAI](https://github.com/ZulAmi/symbioAI)

### Validated Results (October 2025)

**Previous Work: Causal Graph Discovery**

| Experiment         | Graph Learning | Importance Sampling | Task-IL    | Interpretation          |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **DER++ Baseline** | ❌             | ❌                  | **73.81%** | Standard replay         |
| **Graph Only**     | ✅             | ❌                  | **73.88%** | +0.07% (negligible)     |
| **Full Causal**    | ✅             | ✅                  | **71.75%** | -2.06% (sampling hurts) |

**Key Finding**: Graph learning provides interpretability without performance cost, but both importance-weighted and interventional causal sampling degrade accuracy.

**Completed Work: TRUE Interventional Causality (Negative Result)**

We implemented Pearl Level 2 interventional causality for replay selection using gradient-based counterfactual comparisons. Samples are evaluated by measuring their causal effect on preventing forgetting across all previously learned tasks through temporary model updates.

**Implementation Details**:

- Cross-task forgetting measurement: At task N, measure effect on tasks 0...N-1
- Buffer-based extraction: Infer task labels from class structure for historical sample retrieval
- Factual vs counterfactual protocol: Checkpoint model, train with/without sample, measure multi-task forgetting, compute difference
- Intervention parameters: 3 micro-steps, learning rate 0.1, evaluation interval 5

**Experimental Results (CIFAR-100, 3 tasks, 1 epoch)**:

| Method                       | Task-IL | Performance vs Baseline |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| Vanilla DER++ (uniform)      | 33.8%   | Baseline                |
| TRUE Causal (interventional) | 24.4%   | -9.4% (27.8% worse)     |

**Analysis**: Gradient-based interventions produce weak causal signals (effect range: -0.16 to +0.15, mean ≈ -0.006) with 90-96% of samples classified as neutral. Cross-task averaging further dampens discriminative power. The computational overhead (checkpoint/restore operations) is not justified by the resulting performance degradation.

**Research Value**: This rigorous negative result demonstrates fundamental limitations of gradient-based causal proxies for continual learning replay selection, providing important guidance for future work on alternative causal estimation methods.

**CIFAR-100 detailed (primary dataset, 10 tasks, 5 epochs)**:

**Ablation Study (seed 1)**:

**Experiment 1: Full Causal**

- Result: 71.75% Task-IL
- Configuration: Graph learning + importance sampling
- Issue: Top-10 samples always from same task, destroying diversity

**Experiment 2: DER++ Baseline**

- Result: 73.81% Task-IL
- Configuration: Standard DER++ with uniform sampling
- Baseline for comparison

**Experiment 3: Graph Only**

- Result: 73.88% Task-IL (+0.07% vs baseline)
- Configuration: Graph learning enabled, importance sampling disabled
- Graph computed but not used for sampling

**What this means**:

- Graph learning: Free interpretability (+0.07% is noise)
- Importance sampling: Kills performance (-2.06% by destroying diversity)
- Bottom line: You get interpretability without any performance hit

**Causal Graph Discovered (Experiment 3, Graph Only)**:

- 30 strong causal edges (strength threshold 0.5-0.698)
- Task 3 identified as causal hub
- Graph density: 33.3% (30/90 possible edges)
- Mean edge strength: 0.189
- Temporal constraint: Only forward edges (i→j where i<j)
- Key relationships: Task 0→1: 0.678, Task 1→2: 0.676, Task 2→3: 0.698

**Why Importance Sampling Failed**:

DEBUG analysis (1-epoch runs) revealed:

- Full causal with sampling: 49.82% Task-IL (massive degradation)
- Top-10 samples concentrated on single task at each step
- Mean importance 0.55, std 0.20-0.30 creates extreme bias
- Conclusion: Importance weighting destroys balanced replay diversity

### Experimental Validation History

This section documents the complete experimental journey, including both successful and failed experiments. All experiments conducted on CIFAR-100 (10 tasks, 5 epochs) unless otherwise specified.

**Phase 1: Baseline Validation (October 2025)**

Established gold standard comparison using official DER++ implementation from Mammoth framework.

- **Initial Result**: 73.81% Task-IL accuracy (seed 1)
- **Multi-seed Validation (October 27)**: 72.99 ± 0.75% (5 seeds)
- **Configuration**: Buffer size 500, alpha=0.3, beta=0.5, 5 epochs
- **Location**: `validation/results/baseline_multiseed_20251027_112456/`
- **Purpose**: Statistical comparison with CausalDER
- **Status**: Complete - baseline variance established (std=0.75%, CV=1.03%)

**Phase 2: Initial Causal Integration (October 2025)**

First implementation of causal graph discovery integrated with DER++ replay mechanism.

- **Result**: 70.32% Task-IL accuracy
- **Gap**: -3.49% from baseline
- **Configuration**: Basic causal sampling without optimizations
- **Location**: `validation/results/causal_der_v2_baseline_5epoch_seed1.log`
- **Decision**: Met 70% threshold for GO decision - proved concept viability
- **Status**: Success - validated core causal integration works

**Phase 3: Causal Graph Learning (October 2025)**

Attempted more complex causal graph learning with enhanced structural constraints.

- **Result**: 62.3% Task-IL accuracy
- **Gap**: -11.51% from baseline, -7.89% worse than Phase 2
- **Location**: `validation/results/phase3_graph_learning_seed1.log`
- **Issue**: Enhanced graph learning initially degraded performance
- **Lesson**: More complexity does not always improve results
- **Status**: Negative result - led to optimization strategy change

**Quick Wins Optimization (October 2025)**

Initial attempt at optimizing causal sampling with multiple strategies:

1. Warm start blending (gradual transition from uniform to causal sampling)
2. Smoother importance weighting (0.7 causal + 0.3 recency)
3. Adaptive sparsification (dynamic threshold 0.9 to 0.7 quantile)

- **Result**: Still underperformed baseline
- **Root cause discovered**: Importance sampling fundamentally incompatible with balanced replay
- **Lesson**: Optimization cannot fix architectural mismatch
- **Status**: Abandoned - shifted to graph-only approach

**Ablation Studies (October 2025)**

**Experiment 1: Full Causal**

- Graph learning + importance sampling
- Result: 71.75% (-2.06% from baseline)

**Experiment 2: DER++ Baseline**

- No graph learning, no importance sampling
- Result: 73.81% (baseline)

**Experiment 3: Graph Only**

- Graph learning enabled, importance sampling disabled
- Result: 73.88% (+0.07%, within noise)

**Key Findings**:

- Importance sampling: Destroys diversity (-2.06%)
- Location: `validation/results/ablations_20251027_161516/`
- Status: Complete - identified root cause of performance degradation

**Total Compute Time**: ~5.2 hours (6×52min)

**Key Lesson**: Importance sampling breaks balanced replay - graph learning gives you interpretability for free

### Research Contributions

**Primary Contribution: Causal Graph Discovery**

Demonstrated that causal graph learning can be integrated into continual learning for task relationship analysis without performance degradation:

1. **PC Algorithm Integration** - Structural causal model discovery using partial correlation tests
2. **Task-Level Causality** - 30-edge causal graph discovered with temporal constraints (forward-only)
3. **Performance Neutral** - Graph learning adds interpretability with +0.07% impact (within noise)
4. **Hub Identification** - Task 3 identified as causal hub with strongest outgoing edges
5. **Reproducible Protocol** - ResNet-18 feature extraction (512D) with documented hyperparameters

**Secondary Contribution: Negative Results on Causal Sampling**

Rigorously evaluated two causal sampling approaches and documented their failure modes:

**Importance-Weighted Sampling** (Graph-based):

- Performance: -2.06% degradation
- Root cause: Concentrates samples from single tasks, destroying balanced replay diversity
- Lesson: Continual learning requires diversity preservation; importance weighting incompatible

**Interventional Causality** (Pearl Level 2):

- Performance: -9.4% degradation
- Implementation: Gradient-based factual vs. counterfactual comparisons with cross-task measurement
- Root cause: Weak causal signals (effect magnitudes < 0.2), 90-96% neutral samples, insufficient signal-to-noise
- Lesson: Gradient-based micro-interventions inadequate for meaningful causal effect estimation

**Technical Implementation (Interventional Approach):**

```python
# For each candidate buffer sample at task N:
1. Checkpoint model state
2. FACTUAL: Train 3 micro-steps WITH sample → measure loss on tasks 0...N-1
3. Restore checkpoint from saved state
4. COUNTERFACTUAL: Train 3 micro-steps WITHOUT sample → measure loss on tasks 0...N-1
5. Causal effect = factual_forgetting - counterfactual_forgetting
6. Select samples with most negative effects (theory: reduce forgetting)
7. Result: Effects too weak, selection no better than random
```
