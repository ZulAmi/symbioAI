# Symbio AI - Continual Learning Research Platform

## What This Actually Is

A continual learning research platform with 27 training modules (29,752 lines of code). The primary focus is benchmarking continual learning methods on standard datasets to validate whether we can improve upon the DER++ baseline.

**Current Status:** Running experiments on CIFAR-100, validating approaches, seeking academic partnerships.

**Reality Check:** This is experimental research code. Most modules are implemented but untested. We're currently focused on validating one system (continual learning) properly before making claims about the others.
