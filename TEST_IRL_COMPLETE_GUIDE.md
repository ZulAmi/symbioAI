## 🏭 **Production Testing (Advanced)**

### **API Integration Test:**

```bash
# Start API server
python quickstart.py api &

# Wait for startup
sleep 10

# Test with Python (avoids shell issues)
python -c "
import requests
import json

# Health check
health = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8080/health')
print('Health:', health.json())

# Verify property
verify = requests.post(
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/verify',
    json={'property': 'x > 0', 'context': {'x': 5}}
)
print('Verification:', json.dumps(verify.json(), indent=2))
"
```

### **Load Testing:**

```bash
# Install locust
pip install locust

# Create load test
cat > locustfile.py << 'EOF'
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class SymbioUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)

    @task
    def verify(self):
        self.client.post("/api/verify", json={
            "property": "x >= 0",
            "context": {"x": 5}
        })
EOF

# Run load test (100 users)
locust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 100 -r 10 --run-time 5m
```

## ❌ **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Import errors

**Solution:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in project directory
cd "/Users/zulhilmirahmat/Development/programming/Symbio AI"

# Run from project root
python quick_test_irl.py
```

### Issue: Missing dependencies

**Solution:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements-core.txt
pip install PyJWT
```

### Issue: Tests timeout

**Solution:**

- Individual demos have longer timeouts
- Use `python test_irl.py` for automatic timeout handling
- Check system resources (CPU/memory)

### Issue: API won't start

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if PyJWT installed
pip show PyJWT

# Install if missing
pip install PyJWT

# Start API
python quickstart.py api
```
