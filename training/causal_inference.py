Causal Inference Foundations for Continual Learning
====================================================

Implements actual causal inference machinery for continual learning:
1. Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
2. Causal effect estimation via interventions
3. Counterfactual reasoning
4. Causal graph discovery

Based on Pearl's causal hierarchy:
- Level 1 (Association): P(Y|X) - standard ML
- Level 2 (Intervention): P(Y|do(X)) - what we implement here
- Level 3 (Counterfactuals): P(Y_x|X',Y') - what could have been
