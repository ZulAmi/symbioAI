## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the demo (9 comprehensive scenarios)
python examples/metacognitive_causal_demo.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from training.metacognitive_monitoring import create_metacognitive_monitor

# Create monitor
monitor = create_metacognitive_monitor(feature_dim=128)

# Monitor predictions
state = monitor.monitor_prediction(
    features=model_features,
    prediction=output,
    attention_weights=attention
)

# Check state
print(f"Cognitive State: {state.cognitive_state.value}")
print(f"Confidence: {state.prediction_confidence:.3f}")
print(f"Epistemic Uncertainty: {state.epistemic_uncertainty:.3f}")
print(f"Aleatoric Uncertainty: {state.aleatoric_uncertainty:.3f}")

# Get recommendations
if state.recommended_intervention != InterventionType.NO_INTERVENTION:
    print(f"Action: {state.recommended_intervention.value}")
```

### Self-Reflection

```python
# Perform reflection
insights = monitor.reflect_on_performance(time_window=100)

for insight in insights:
    print(f"{insight.insight_type}: {insight.description}")
    print(f"Impact: {insight.expected_impact:.2%}")
    for rec in insight.recommendations:
        print(f"  • {rec}")
```

### Reasoning Trace

```python
# Trace reasoning
monitor.reasoning_tracer.trace_reasoning_step(
    step_id="step_1",
    step_type="retrieval",
    inputs=query,
    outputs=results,
    confidence=0.9
)

# Analyze
analysis = monitor.reasoning_tracer.analyze_reasoning_path()
print(f"Steps: {analysis['num_steps']}")
print(f"Bottlenecks: {', '.join(analysis['bottlenecks'])}")
```
