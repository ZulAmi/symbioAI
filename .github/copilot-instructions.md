# Symbio AI - Modular AI System

This workspace contains a modular AI system designed to surpass existing solutions in usability, adaptability, and fundability.

## Project Architecture

- `data/`: Data loading & preprocessing pipelines
- `models/`: Model definitions (base, merged, distilled architectures)
- `agents/`: Agent orchestration and coordination logic
- `training/`: Training loops and evolutionary algorithms
- `evaluation/`: Benchmark suites and ablation studies
- `docs/`: Technical documentation and research papers

## Development Guidelines

- Follow modular design principles
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Maintain clear documentation
- Focus on investor-ready deliverables
- Prioritize usability and adaptability

## Code Style

- Use type hints for Python code
- Follow PEP 8 standards
- Implement proper error handling
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use configuration files for hyperparameters
