# Evolutionary Skill Learning - Symbio AI

## Overview

The Evolutionary Skill Learning system implements nature-inspired algorithms to evolve populations of AI agents that develop specialized skills through natural selection, crossover, and mutation operations. This approach follows patterns similar to Sakana's CycleQD methodology but with enhanced multi-task capability and niche specialization.

## Algorithm Structure

Following the exact prompt specification:

### 1. Population Initialization

```
Initialize a population of N agent models with different random seeds or initializations
```

- Creates diverse initial population with unique random seeds
- Each agent has distinct neural network parameters
- Population size configurable (default: 20-50 agents)

### 2. Generation Evolution Loop

#### 2a. Task Evaluation

```
Evaluate each agent on a set of tasks (compute a fitness score per agent)
```

- Multi-task assessment across diverse skill domains
- Concurrent evaluation for performance optimization
- Weighted fitness scoring based on task importance

#### 2b. Elite Selection

```
Select top-performing agents (elitism) for breeding
```

- Tournament selection with configurable tournament size
- Roulette wheel selection based on fitness proportions
- Rank-based selection for balanced exploration

#### 2c. Genetic Operations

```
Generate new agents by crossover (merge parameters of two parents)
and mutation (perturb weights or use SVD on weights)
```

**Crossover Strategies:**

- Parameter averaging with adaptive mixing ratios
- Layer-wise swapping for architectural diversity
- Weighted merging based on parent fitness
- Genetic-style crossover with random crossover points

**Mutation Strategies:**

- Gaussian noise perturbation
- SVD-based parameter perturbation
- Dropout-style weight zeroing
- Layer-wise adaptive mutation
- Performance-based adaptive mutation strength

#### 2d. Population Replacement

```
Replace the worst-performing agents with new offspring
```

- Maintains population size consistency
- Balances elite preservation with diversity
- Configurable ratios for elitism/crossover/mutation

### 3. Convergence and Termination

```
Iterate for G generations or until convergence
```

- Stagnation detection with configurable thresholds
- Maximum generation limits
- Early stopping for computational efficiency

### 4. Result Extraction

```
Return the best agent models and their niche specializations
```

- Top performers by overall fitness
- Diverse agents covering different specializations
- Specialization clustering and analysis

    convergence_threshold: float = 0.001  # Fitness improvement threshold
    max_stagnation: int = 10           # Generations before convergence
```

best_agents = results['best_agents']
diverse_agents = results['diverse_agents']
```

```python
from training.evolution import MultiTaskEvaluator

async def custom_task(model):
    # Your task evaluation logic
    return fitness_score

tasks = {'custom': custom_task}
evaluator = MultiTaskEvaluator(tasks)
learner = EvolutionarySkillLearner(config, evaluator)
