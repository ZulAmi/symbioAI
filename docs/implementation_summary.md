    Includes selection, mutation, crossover, and hyperparameters.
    """
```

**Features**:

def calculate_meta_fitness(
    strategy_genome: EvolutionStrategyGenome,
    metrics: MetaEvolutionMetrics
) -> float:
    """

    Enables principled understanding of what makes strategies work.
    """
```

## 🔧 Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

#### 1. Evolutionary Training (`training/evolution.py`)

```python
# Use learned strategy
best_strategy = engine.get_universal_best_strategy()
config = best_strategy.to_evolution_config()
trainer = EvolutionaryTrainer(config, model_factory, evaluator)
```

#### 2. Distributed Marketplace (`marketplace/patch_marketplace.py`)

```python
# Share learned strategies
manifest = create_strategy_manifest(best_strategy)
await PATCH_MARKETPLACE.publish_patch(manifest, artifacts)
```

#### 3. Self-Healing (`training/auto_surgery.py`)

```python
# Use evolved strategy for healing
config = learned_strategy.to_evolution_config()
surgery = AutoModelSurgery(config)
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Meta-Training

```python
from training.recursive_self_improvement import create_recursive_improvement_engine

engine = create_recursive_improvement_engine(
    meta_population_size=20,
    meta_generations=30,
    base_task_budget=100
)

results = await engine.meta_train(
    task_evaluators={"task1": eval1, "task2": eval2},
    model_factory=create_model
)

best = engine.get_universal_best_strategy()
config = best.to_evolution_config()
```

### Task-Specific Strategy

```python
# Get specialized strategy
classification_strategy = engine.get_best_strategy_for_task("classification")
config = classification_strategy.to_evolution_config()

# Use for new classification tasks
trainer = EvolutionaryTrainer(config, model_factory, evaluator)
results = await trainer.train()
```

### Export and Reuse

```python
# Export learned strategies
engine.export_learned_strategies(Path("./strategies.json"))

# Later, load and use
with open("strategies.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
genome = EvolutionStrategyGenome(**data["top_universal_strategies"][0])
config = genome.to_evolution_config()
```
