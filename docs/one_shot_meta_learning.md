# Initialize engine
config = OneShotMetaLearningConfig(
    algorithm=MetaLearningAlgorithm.MAML_CAUSAL,
    support_shots=1,  # True one-shot learning
    causal_weight=0.6,
    enable_causal_priors=True
)

engine = OneShotMetaLearningEngine(config)
await engine.initialize(input_dim=84, output_dim=5)
```

### CausalMetaModel

```python
model = CausalMetaModel(
    input_dim=84,
    hidden_dim=128,
    output_dim=5,
    num_mechanisms=5
)

# Forward pass with causal intervention
output = model(input_data, causal_mask=intervention_mask)
```

### MAMLCausalLearner

```python
learner = MAMLCausalLearner(config, model)

# Meta-train with causal mechanism discovery
results = await learner.meta_train(source_tasks)

# Adapt to new task with causal priors
adapted_model = await learner.adapt(target_task, support_data)
```

    engine = create_one_shot_meta_learning_engine(
        algorithm=MetaLearningAlgorithm.MAML_CAUSAL,
        support_shots=1,
        causal_weight=0.5
    )

    # Initialize for your problem
    await engine.initialize(input_dim=784, output_dim=10)

    # Meta-train on source tasks
    training_results = await engine.meta_train(source_tasks)

    # Adapt to new task with single example
    support_data = (single_example, single_label)
    adaptation_results = await engine.one_shot_adapt(target_task, support_data)

    print(f"Adapted in {adaptation_results['adaptation_time']:.2f}s")
    print(f"Accuracy: {adaptation_results['adaptation_quality']['accuracy']:.3f}")

asyncio.run(one_shot_example())
```

print(f"Discovered {insights['total_mechanisms']} mechanisms")
print(f"Average effectiveness: {insights['average_effectiveness']:.3f}")

# Analyze strongest mechanisms
for mech in insights['strongest_mechanisms']:

enhanced_mechanisms = engine.enhance_mechanisms_with_graph(causal_graph)
```

### With Cross-Task Transfer

transfer_relationships = transfer_engine.discover_relationships(tasks)
engine.set_transfer_priors(transfer_relationships)
```

### With Recursive Self-Improvement

```python
# Evolve meta-learning strategies
evolved_config = await rsi_engine.evolve_meta_config(
    current_config=engine.config,
    performance_history=adaptation_results
)
```

### With Marketplace

```python
# Share and reuse discovered mechanisms
await engine.export_mechanisms("marketplace/mechanisms/one_shot_causal.json")
shared_mechanisms = marketplace.load_mechanisms("one_shot_causal")
engine.import_mechanisms(shared_mechanisms)
```

## Advanced Features

### Mechanism Intervention

```python
# Apply specific causal interventions during adaptation
intervention_mask = engine.create_intervention_mask(
    mechanisms=relevant_mechanisms,
    intervention_strength=0.8
)

adapted_model = await engine.adapt_with_intervention(
    task=target_task,
    support_data=support_data,
    intervention_mask=intervention_mask
)
```

### Hierarchical Adaptation

```python
# Multi-level adaptation using causal hierarchies
hierarchy_results = await engine.hierarchical_adapt(
    target_task=target_task,
    adaptation_levels=["feature", "structure", "optimization"],
    support_data=support_data
)
```

### Continual Mechanism Learning

```python
# Continuously update mechanisms as new tasks arrive
async for new_task in task_stream:
    # Adapt to new task
    adaptation_result = await engine.one_shot_adapt(new_task, support_data)

    # Update mechanism knowledge
    await engine.update_mechanisms(new_task, adaptation_result)

    # Refine existing mechanisms
    await engine.refine_mechanisms_online()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Poor Adaptation Performance**

- Increase `causal_weight` to emphasize mechanism learning
- Reduce `mechanism_threshold` to include more mechanisms
- Increase `num_inner_steps` for more adaptation

**Slow Adaptation**

- Reduce `adaptation_steps` for faster adaptation
- Use smaller models or reduce `num_mechanisms`
- Enable `enable_causal_priors` for guided adaptation

**Mechanism Discovery Issues**

- Increase `num_meta_iterations` for more mechanism discovery
- Use more diverse source tasks
- Adjust `causal_weight` balance

### Debugging Tools

```python
# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.getLogger('training.one_shot_meta_learning').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Inspect mechanism discovery
mechanisms = engine.discovered_mechanisms
for mech in mechanisms:
    print(f"Mechanism: {mech.mechanism_type}")
    print(f"Strength: {mech.causal_strength}")
    print(f"Effectiveness: {mech.effectiveness}")

# Analyze adaptation process
adaptation_trace = engine.get_adaptation_trace(target_task)
```
