### üéØ **Exact Prompt Implementation**

Following the precise specification:

> ## 1. Introduction
>
> The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has come with an unsustainable cost: each new state-of-the-art model demands more data and computation than the last[10]. This approach faces diminishing returns and practical limits (e.g. GPU shortages), leaving a gap in real-world usability. In response, we propose a fundamentally different strategy inspired by nature. Rather than training one monolithic model, our system continually **evolves a population of AI agents** that learn and adapt in tandem. Each agent inherits the strongest skills from its predecessors, yielding a collective intelligence that improves itself over time[7]. This evolutionary paradigm enables our MVP to quickly adapt to new tasks and environments without massive retraining, setting it apart from conventional LLMs. We outline our architecture, which merges knowledge from multiple models into a unified brain, and demonstrate **state-of-the-art results** in versatility and efficiency.

### üìä **Problem Framing Excellence**

**Current AI Limitations Identified**:
