## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Task Relationship Graph (GNN)

```python
class TaskRelationshipGraph(nn.Module):
    """
    Graph Neural Network for modeling task relationships.
    Learns embeddings that capture similarity and transferability.
    """
```

**Capabilities**:

- Task embedding encoding
- Graph convolution (message passing)
- Relation-specific transformations
- Transfer coefficient prediction
- Curriculum order generation
- Task difficulty estimation

### 2. Automatic Relationship Discovery

```python
engine.register_task(task, model)
# Relationships automatically discovered!
```

**Features**:

- Analyzes task characteristics (domain, type, skills)
- Computes similarity scores
- Classifies relationships (similar, complementary, independent)
- Quantifies transfer coefficients
- Identifies shared representations
- Logs discovery events

### 3. Curriculum Generation

```python
curriculum = await engine.generate_curriculum(
    target_task="object_detection",
    strategy=CurriculumStrategy.TRANSFER_POTENTIAL,
    max_tasks=5
)
```

**Strategies**:

- **EASY_TO_HARD**: Order by difficulty (foundational learning)
- **TRANSFER_POTENTIAL**: Order by transfer benefit (maximize reuse)
- **DIVERSE_SAMPLING**: Maximize task diversity
- **UNCERTAINTY_DRIVEN**: Focus on uncertain areas

)
```

**Capabilities**:

- Extract domain-invariant representations

### 5. Zero-Shot Task Synthesis

```python
model = await engine.synthesize_zero_shot_model(
    new_task=task,
    synthesis_strategy="weighted_ensemble"
)
```

- **Weighted Ensemble**: Combine related models with learned weights
- **Knowledge Composition**: Compose meta-knowledge pieces
- **Analogy Transfer**: Apply structural analogies

**Benefits**:

engine.export_transfer_graph(Path("graph.json"))
```

**Metrics**:

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Create engine
engine = create_cross_task_transfer_engine(auto_discover=True)

# 2. Register tasks
for task, model in tasks_and_models:
    engine.register_task(task, model)

# 3. Automatic discovery happens
# Wait for discovery
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

# 4. Generate curriculum for new task
curriculum = await engine.generate_curriculum(
    target_task="new_task_id",
    strategy=CurriculumStrategy.TRANSFER_POTENTIAL
)

# 5. Train following curriculum
for task_id in curriculum.task_sequence:
    results = await train_on_task(task_id)
    # Knowledge transfers automatically!

# 6. Or use zero-shot synthesis
model = await engine.synthesize_zero_shot_model(
    new_task=unseen_task,
    synthesis_strategy="weighted_ensemble"
)
# Deploy instantly!

# 7. Analyze transfer graph
metrics = engine.get_transfer_graph_metrics()
engine.export_transfer_graph(Path("./transfer_graph.json"))
```
