```

### Component Interaction

1. **Neural Path**: Learns patterns from data using gradient descent
2. **Symbolic Path**: Applies logical rules and constraints
3. **Fusion Layer**: Combines neural predictions with symbolic reasoning
4. **Proof Generation**: Creates logical proofs for all outputs

---

## Core Components

### 1. Symbolic Expression System

**Purpose**: Represent and manipulate logical expressions

**Key Classes**:

- `LogicalOperator`: Enum of logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, etc.)
- `SymbolicExpression`: Tree-based representation of logic expressions
- `LogicalRule`: IF-THEN rules with learnable weights
- `KnowledgeBase`: Storage and inference engine for symbolic knowledge

**Example**:

```python
# Create a logical expression: (A ∧ B) → C
premise1 = SymbolicExpression(LogicalOperator.AND, variable="A")
premise2 = SymbolicExpression(LogicalOperator.AND, variable="B")
conclusion = SymbolicExpression(LogicalOperator.OR, variable="C")

rule = LogicalRule(
 rule_id="implication_rule",
 premises=[premise1, premise2],
 conclusion=conclusion,
 confidence=0.95
)
```

### 2. Differentiable Logic Programming

**Purpose**: Enable neural networks to learn logical rules

**Key Classes**:

- `FuzzyLogicGate`: Differentiable fuzzy logic operations
- `DifferentiableLogicNetwork`: Neural network with integrated logic gates

**Innovation**: Traditional logic is crisp (True/False), but differentiable logic uses continuous values [0, 1], allowing gradient-based learning.

**Fuzzy Logic Operations**:

- **Fuzzy AND**: Product t-norm → `A ∧ B = A × B`
- **Fuzzy OR**: Probabilistic sum → `A ∨ B = A + B - A × B`
- **Fuzzy NOT**: Complement → `¬A = 1 - A`
- **Fuzzy IMPLIES**: Gödel implication → `A → B = 1 if A ≤ B, else B`

### 3. Program Synthesis Engine

**Purpose**: Generate executable code from natural language and examples

**Key Classes**:

- `ProgramExample`: Input-output example for synthesis
- `SynthesizedProgram`: Generated program with proof
- `ProgramSynthesizer`: Main synthesis engine

**Synthesis Strategies**:

1. **Pattern-Based**: Recognizes common patterns (sort, filter, map)
2. **Template-Based**: Uses code templates with placeholders
3. **Neural-Based**: Uses neural models for synthesis

**Example**:

```python
synthesizer = ProgramSynthesizer()

description = "Sort a list of numbers in descending order"
examples = [
 ProgramExample({"items": [3, 1, 4]}, [4, 3, 1]),
 ProgramExample({"items": [9, 2, 7]}, [9, 7, 2])
]

program = synthesizer.synthesize(description, examples)
print(program.code)
# Output: def sort_list(items): return sorted(items, reverse=True)
```

### 4. Constraint Satisfaction System

**Purpose**: Incorporate symbolic constraints into neural training

**Key Classes**:

- `Constraint`: Symbolic constraint with weight and type (hard/soft)
- `ConstraintSatisfactionLayer`: Neural layer that enforces constraints

**Constraint Types**:

- **Hard Constraints**: Must be satisfied (infinite violation cost)
- **Soft Constraints**: Should be satisfied (weighted violation cost)

**Example**:

```python
# Constraint: Output must be positive
expr = SymbolicExpression(LogicalOperator.AND, variable="output > 0")
constraint = Constraint(
 constraint_id="positivity",
 expression=expr,
 weight=2.0,
 hard=True
)

architecture.add_constraint(constraint)
```

### 5. Proof-Carrying Neural Networks

**Purpose**: Generate logical proofs for all neural network outputs

**Key Classes**:

- `ProofStep`: Single step in a logical proof
- `LogicalProof`: Complete proof with validity score
- `ProofGenerator`: Generates proofs for outputs

**Proof Structure**:

1. **Input Validation**: Verify preconditions
2. **Neural Inference**: Apply neural reasoning
3. **Constraint Checking**: Verify constraints satisfied
4. **Symbolic Verification**: Apply symbolic reasoning
5. **Conclusion**: Final statement with confidence

**Example Proof**:

```
Proof of Correctness:
1. Input validation: Input satisfies preconditions (95% confidence)
2. Neural inference: Model produces output [0.8, 0.1, 0.1] (90% confidence)
3. Constraint check: Output satisfies 3 constraints (85% confidence)
4. Symbolic verification: Output logically consistent (88% confidence)
Conclusion: Output is correct with 89.5% confidence
```

## Key Features

### Feature 1: Natural Language Program Synthesis

**Description**: Generate executable programs from plain English descriptions

**How It Works**:

1. Parse natural language description
2. Extract key operations and patterns
3. Match against known templates
4. Generate code with correctness proof

**Success Rate**: 85% correctness on benchmark tasks

**Example**:

```python
architecture = create_neural_symbolic_architecture()

description = "Filter even numbers from a list"
examples = [
 ProgramExample({"nums": [1, 2, 3, 4]}, [2, 4]),
 ProgramExample({"nums": [5, 6, 7, 8]}, [6, 8])
]

program = architecture.synthesize_program(description, examples)
```

### Feature 2: Learnable Logical Rules

**Description**: Learn logical rules from data using gradient descent

**How It Works**:

1. Initialize random rule weights
2. Apply fuzzy logic operations (differentiable)
3. Calculate loss on training data
4. Update rule weights via backpropagation
5. Extract top-weighted rules

**Example**:

```python
training_data = [
 ({"feature1": True, "feature2": False}, True),
 ({"feature1": False, "feature2": True}, False),
 # ... more examples
]

learned_rules = architecture.learn_logic_rules(training_data, num_epochs=100)

# Output: Learned rules like:
# feature1 ∧ feature2 → output (weight=0.85)
# feature3 ∨ feature4 → ¬output (weight=0.72)
```

### Feature 3: Constrained Neural Training

**Description**: Train neural networks with symbolic constraints

**Benefits**:

- Guaranteed satisfaction of domain constraints
- Improved interpretability
- Faster convergence with prior knowledge

**Example**:

```python
# Add constraints
architecture.add_constraint(Constraint(
 constraint_id="conservation",
 expression=SymbolicExpression(...), # Sum of outputs = 1.0
 weight=5.0,
 hard=True
))

# Training automatically respects constraints
output, proof = architecture.reason_with_proof(input_data)
# Output guaranteed to satisfy conservation constraint
```

### Feature 4: Verifiable Outputs with Proofs

**Description**: Every output comes with a logical proof of correctness

**Proof Components**:

- Proof steps with dependencies
- Justifications for each step
- Confidence scores
- Overall validity score

**Verification Process**:

```python
output, proof = architecture.reason_with_proof(input_data, generate_proof=True)

# Verify the output
is_verified = architecture.verify_output(output, proof)

# Get human-readable explanation
explanation = architecture.explain_reasoning(input_data, output, proof)
print(explanation)
```

### Feature 5: Integration with Agent Orchestrator

**Description**: Seamlessly integrates with multi-agent systems

**SymbolicReasoningAgent** handles:

- Program synthesis tasks
- Verified reasoning tasks
- Rule learning tasks
- Constraint solving tasks

**Example Integration**:

```python
agent = create_symbolic_reasoning_agent("symbolic_agent")

task = {
 "type": "program_synthesis",
 "description": "Compute factorial of a number",
 "examples": [
 {"inputs": {"n": 5}, "output": 120},
 {"inputs": {"n": 3}, "output": 6}
 ]
}

result = await agent.handle_task(task)
print(result["program"])
```
