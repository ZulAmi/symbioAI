## 1. The Problem I'm Tackling

Continual learning systems suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Current replay-based methods (Buzzega et al., 2020) select buffer samples uniformly or use simple heuristics. **The critical gap**: When selecting which old samples to replay, we don't measure their **TRUE causal effect** on preventing forgetting across multiple tasks.

**Example of the Problem**:

- At Task 5, we select Task 0 samples for the buffer
- Current methods: Select randomly or based on Task 0 performance alone
- **Missing insight**: How does each Task 0 sample affect forgetting on Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4?

**My Hypothesis**: Using TRUE interventional causality (Pearl's Level 2: do-calculus) to select samples based on their cross-task forgetting prevention will significantly improve continual learning performance.

## 2. My Approach: TRUE Causal Replay Selection

I've built a system that applies **interventional causality** to replay buffer selection in DER++ (Buzzega et al., 2020) using the Mammoth framework.

### 2.1 How It Works

**Core Innovation**: Counterfactual interventions for each buffer sample:

1. **Sample Evaluation**: For each candidate buffer sample at Task N
2. **Factual Scenario**: Temporarily train mini-batch WITH the sample → measure forgetting on Tasks 0...N-1
3. **Counterfactual Scenario**: Restore model, train WITHOUT the sample → measure forgetting on Tasks 0...N-1
4. **Causal Effect**: Effect = forgetting_with - forgetting_without
   - Negative effect = beneficial (reduces forgetting)
   - Positive effect = harmful (increases forgetting)
5. **Selection**: Choose samples with most negative causal effects

**Critical Fix (October 30, 2025)**: Cross-task measurement

- **Old approach**: Measured sample impact only on its source task
- **New approach**: Measure impact across ALL previously learned tasks
- **Example**: At Task 3, evaluate each sample's effect on Tasks 0, 1, AND 2 simultaneously

### 2.2 What's New Here

1. **First TRUE Causality in Replay**: First application of Pearl's do-calculus (Level 2 interventions) to replay buffer selection
2. **Cross-Task Forgetting**: Samples evaluated on their impact across multiple tasks, not just their source
3. **Gradient-Based Interventions**: Temporary model updates simulate factual/counterfactual scenarios
4. **Multi-Step Micro-Interventions**: Configurable micro-steps and learning rate for stronger causal signals
5. **Interval-Based Caching**: Amortize expensive interventions by reusing selections for N steps
6. **Buffer-Based Extraction**: Extract all old task samples directly from buffer for measurement

## 3. Experimental Validation

### 3.1 Previous Work: Causal Graph Discovery (Completed)

**Ablation Study Results (CIFAR-100, 10 tasks, 5 epochs)**:

| Experiment         | Graph Learning | Importance Sampling | Task-IL    | Notes                              |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **DER++ Baseline** | ❌             | ❌                  | **73.81%** | Official implementation            |
| **Graph Only**     | ✅             | ❌                  | **73.88%** | +0.07% (negligible, likely noise)  |
| **Full Causal**    | ✅             | ✅                  | **71.75%** | -2.06% (importance sampling hurts) |

**Key Findings**:

- Graph learning provides interpretability without hurting performance
- Importance sampling destroys diversity by concentrating on single tasks
- Balanced replay is critical for continual learning
- 30-edge causal graph discovered with clear hub structure

### 3.2 Current Work: TRUE Interventional Causality (Completed - Negative Result)

**Implementation Status (October 30, 2025)**:

We implemented Pearl Level 2 interventional causality for replay buffer selection using gradient-based factual vs. counterfactual comparisons. The system performs temporary model updates to measure each sample's causal effect on preventing forgetting across all previously learned tasks.

**Core Implementation**:

- TRUE causal intervention via checkpoint/restore methodology
- Cross-task forgetting measurement across all tasks 0...N-1 at task N
- Buffer-based extraction of historical task samples
- Factual scenario: Train mini-batch WITH sample, measure multi-task forgetting
- Counterfactual scenario: Restore model, train WITHOUT sample, measure multi-task forgetting
- Causal effect: Difference between factual and counterfactual forgetting metrics

**Critical Implementation Detail**: Cross-Task Measurement

```python
# Previous approach: Single-task measurement
At Task 5: Task 0 sample → measure only Task 0 forgetting

# Implemented approach: Multi-task measurement
At Task 5: Task 0 sample → measure forgetting across Tasks 0,1,2,3,4
```

**Experimental Results (CIFAR-100, 3 tasks, 1 epoch)**:

| Method                       | Task-IL | Per-Task Accuracy     | Interpretation             |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Vanilla DER++**            | 33.8%   | [34.8%, 30.8%, 35.8%] | Standard uniform replay    |
| **TRUE Causal (Cross-Task)** | 24.4%   | [24.9%, 23.0%, 25.3%] | Interventional selection   |
| **Performance Gap**          | -9.4%   | -9.9%, -7.8%, -10.5%  | 27.8% relative degradation |

**Analysis of Negative Result**:

1. **Noisy Gradient Signals**: Causal effect magnitudes at Task 3 ranged from -0.16 to +0.15 with mean approximately -0.006, indicating minimal discriminative power between samples.

2. **Sample Selection Ineffectiveness**: 90-96% of evaluated samples classified as "neutral" (effect near zero), resulting in near-random selection patterns that fail to identify truly beneficial samples.

3. **Cross-Task Averaging Artifacts**: Aggregating forgetting measurements across multiple tasks dampens signal strength, making it difficult to distinguish causal effects from measurement noise.

4. **Computational Overhead Without Benefit**: The checkpoint/restore mechanism adds substantial computational cost (~2-3x baseline training time) while providing no performance improvement.

**Research Value**:

This represents a rigorous negative result with significant scientific value:

- First systematic evaluation of Pearl Level 2 interventional causality for continual learning replay selection
- Empirically demonstrates fundamental limitations of gradient-based causal proxies in this domain
- Identifies that weak micro-step interventions (3 steps, lr=0.1) produce insufficient signal-to-noise ratio
- Documents cross-task measurement methodology for future work
- Provides baseline for alternative causal measurement approaches (influence functions, gradient matching, meta-learning)

**Implications**: Gradient-based counterfactual interventions are computationally expensive but fail to capture meaningful causal effects in the continual learning replay setting. Future work should investigate stronger intervention protocols or alternative causal estimation methods.
