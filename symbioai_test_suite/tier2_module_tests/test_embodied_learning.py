"""
Phase 1 Critical Test: Embodied Learning (Test 14/15)

Tests embodied AI and tool learning capabilities:
- Tool use learning
- Sensorimotor integration
- World model prediction
- Spatial reasoning

Competitive Advantage:
Embodied learning enables agents to interact with environments
and use tools, going beyond pure language/vision tasks.
