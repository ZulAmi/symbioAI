"""
Phase 1 Critical Test: Adversarial Multi-Agent Training (Test 9/9)

Tests adversarial and competitive multi-agent dynamics:
- Adversarial agent pairs
- Competitive training scenarios
- Robust strategy emergence
- Mixed cooperative-competitive tasks

Competitive Advantage:
Adversarial training creates more robust agents through competition,
similar to GANs but for multi-agent RL.
