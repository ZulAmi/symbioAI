# üöÄ Embodied AI Simulation - Quick Start Guide

**5-Minute Reference** | ‚è±Ô∏è Time to First Result: 30 seconds

---

## üéØ What Is This?

**AI agents that learn through physical interaction** in simulated environments‚Äîgrounding language concepts in sensorimotor experience, learning tool use, spatial navigation, and manipulation.

**Why You Need This**: Language models (GPT-4, Claude) can describe the physical world but don't understand it. Embodied AI _experiences_ it.

## ‚ö° Quick Test (30 seconds)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python examples/embodied_ai_demo.py
```

**Output**: 8 comprehensive demos (~5-7 minutes total)

## üì¶ Core Components (5 Classes)

### 1. **PhysicsEngine** - Simulate Physical World

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import PhysicsEngine
import numpy as np

physics = PhysicsEngine(gravity=-9.81, dt=0.01)
physics.add_object("box", np.array([0, 0, 5]), mass=1.0)

for _ in range(100):
    state = physics.step()  # Simulate falling box
```

**Use When**: Need realistic physics (gravity, friction, collisions)

---

### 2. **SensorimotorEncoder** - Multi-Modal Perception

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import SensorimotorEncoder, SensoryInput
import torch

encoder = SensorimotorEncoder(embedding_dim=256)

sensory_input = SensoryInput(
    vision=torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64),      # RGB
    depth=torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64),       # Depth map
    proprioception=torch.randn(1, 12),      # Joint angles
    touch=torch.randn(1, 8)                 # Tactile sensors
)

embedding = encoder(sensory_input)  # 256-dim unified representation
```

**Use When**: Fuse vision, depth, proprioception, touch into single embedding

---

### 3. **ConceptGrounder** - Language ‚Üí Physical

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import ConceptGrounder
import torch

grounder = ConceptGrounder()

language_input = torch.randn(1, 512)        # "red cube"
sensorimotor_input = torch.randn(1, 256)    # visual + tactile

concept_idx, score = grounder.ground_concept(language_input, sensorimotor_input)
print(f"Concept {concept_idx.item()} grounded with {score.item():.2%} confidence")

affordances = grounder.retrieve_affordances(concept_idx)
```

**Use When**: Map language to physical properties and affordances

---

### 4. **ToolUseLearner** - Learn Tool Use

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import ToolUseLearner
import torch

learner = ToolUseLearner(state_dim=256, num_tools=10)

state = torch.randn(256)
tools = ["hammer", "screwdriver", "wrench"]

affordances = learner.detect_affordances(state, tools)
# {"hammer": 0.87, "screwdriver": 0.23, "wrench": 0.51}

best_tool = max(affordances, key=affordances.get)
action = learner.get_tool_policy(best_tool, state)
```

**Use When**: Detect tool affordances and learn skills through experience

---

### 5. **EmbodiedAgent** - Complete Agent

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import (
    create_embodied_agent,
    create_simulation_environment
)

agent = create_embodied_agent(state_dim=256, use_physics=True)
env = create_simulation_environment(grid_size=(10, 10, 5))

# Training loop
for episode in range(100):
    sensory_input = env.reset()

    states, actions, rewards = [], [], []
    for step in range(50):
        state = agent.perceive(sensory_input)
        action = agent.plan_action(available_tools=env.tools)

        sensory_input, reward, done = env.step(action)

        states.append(state)
        actions.append(action)
        rewards.append(reward)

        if done:
            break

    agent.learn_from_experience(states, actions, rewards)

stats = agent.get_statistics()
# {'manipulation_success_rate': 0.92, 'tools_learned': 5}
```

**Use When**: Need complete embodied agent with perception, planning, and learning

---

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### 1. **Robotics Training**

Train robots in simulation 100√ó faster than real-world.

```python
agent = create_embodied_agent(use_physics=True)
env = create_simulation_environment()

# Train in simulation
for episode in range(1000):
    # ... training loop ...
    pass

# Deploy to real robot (sim-to-real transfer)
```

---

### 2. **Embodied Question Answering**

Answer "how" questions through physical interaction.

```python
grounder = ConceptGrounder()

# Question: "How do you use a hammer?"
concept_idx, _ = grounder.ground_concept(lang_emb("hammer"), sensor_emb)
affordances = grounder.retrieve_affordances(concept_idx)
# Returns: physical properties, actions, graspability
```

---

### 3. **Tool Use Learning**

Automatically learn to use tools through experience.

```python
learner = ToolUseLearner(state_dim=256, num_tools=10)

# Simulate 10 episodes with hammer
for episode in range(10):
    states, actions = simulate_tool_use("hammer")
    success = evaluate_success()
    learner.learn_tool_use("hammer", states, actions, success)

# After 10 episodes: 85%+ success rate
```

---

### 4. **Spatial Navigation**

Build cognitive maps and navigate environments.

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import SpatialReasoningModule

spatial = SpatialReasoningModule(feature_dim=256, map_size=64)

# Update map with observations
spatial.update_map(observation, agent_position=(10, 10))

# Plan path to goal
path = spatial.plan_path(start=(10, 10), goal=(50, 50))
# Returns: [(10,10), (15,12), (20,15), ..., (50,50)]
```

---

### 5. **Manipulation Control**

7 DOF manipulation with grasp quality prediction.

```python
from training.embodied_ai_simulation import ManipulationController

controller = ManipulationController(observation_dim=256, action_dim=7)

action, grasp_quality = controller(observation)

if grasp_quality > 0.7:
    execute_grasp(action)  # Good grasp
else:
    reposition()  # Bad grasp, try again
```

env = create_simulation_environment()

for episode in range(100):
    obs = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        state = agent.perceive(obs)
        action = agent.plan_action()  # Automatic tool selection

```

### Recipe 2: Ground Language in Physics

```python

# Physical interaction
sensory_input = interact_with_object("red_cube")
sensor_emb = encoder(sensory_input)

# Ground language
lang_emb = language_model("red cube")
concept_idx, score = grounder.ground_concept(lang_emb, sensor_emb)

# Result: Language grounded in sensorimotor experience
```

### Recipe 3: Learn Tool from Demonstration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Not Enough Episodes

**Problem**: Tool use requires 5-10 episodes to learn  
**Solution**: Train for at least 10 episodes per tool

### Pitfall 2: Insufficient Sensory Diversity

**Problem**: Agent overfits to specific viewpoints  
**Solution**: Vary camera angles, lighting, object positions

### Pitfall 3: Sparse Rewards

**Problem**: Agent doesn't learn from failed attempts  
**Solution**: Use shaped rewards (distance to goal, partial success)

### Pitfall 4: Static Environment

**Problem**: Agent memorizes instead of learning  
**Solution**: Randomize object positions, tools, goals
