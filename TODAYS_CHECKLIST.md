## üìä **COST TRACKING:**

| Item                | Time       | Cost        |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Setup/testing       | **\_** hrs | $**\_**     |
| Benchmark mode      | **\_**     | **\_**      |
| **Estimated total** | **\_** hrs | **$**\_**** |

## üÜò **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:**

### **Can't SSH:**

```bash
# Try with explicit key:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your-key> ubuntu@<YOUR-IP>
```

### **Upload too slow:**

```bash
# Alternative - use git:
# On Lambda:
git clone https://github.com/ZulAmi/symbioAI.git
cd symbioAI
```

### **Benchmarks crash:**

```bash
# Check what happened:
tmux attach -t benchmarks

# Look for error messages
# If it's adapter-related, that's expected (we skip those)
```

### **Need help:**

- Check LAMBDA_LABS_QUICKSTART.md
- Check PREFLIGHT_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md
- Ask me for help!
