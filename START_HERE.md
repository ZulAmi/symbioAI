## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small:** Run `theorem_proving_demo.py` first (most impressive, quick)
2. **Check Output:** Pay attention to metrics (accuracy %, improvements, etc.)
3. **Read Docs:** Each demo prints references to detailed documentation
4. **Explore Code:** Demo files are ~200-400 lines, easy to read and modify
5. **Use Health Check:** Run `python quickstart.py health` if something seems broken
