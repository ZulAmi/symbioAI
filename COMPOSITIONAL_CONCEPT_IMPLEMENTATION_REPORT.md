## 🔗 Integration Points

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### 1. Agent Orchestrator

```python
# Compositional reasoning agent
class ConceptualReasoningAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self.concept_learner = create_compositional_concept_learner()
        capabilities = AgentCapabilities(
            supported_tasks=[TaskType.REASONING, TaskType.ANALYSIS],
            specializations=["compositional_reasoning", "concept_learning"]
        )
        super().__init__(agent_id, capabilities)

    async def execute_task(self, task: Task) -> Any:
        # Use concept learning for reasoning
        objects = self.concept_learner.perceive_objects(task.payload["input"])
        result = self.concept_learner.abstract_reasoning(
            task.payload["query"],
            [obj.object_id for obj in objects]
        )
        return result
```

#### 2. Neural-Symbolic Architecture

```python
# Concepts provide symbolic grounding for neural-symbolic reasoning
from training.compositional_concept_learning import create_compositional_concept_learner
from training.neural_symbolic_architecture import NeuralSymbolicArchitecture

learner = create_compositional_concept_learner()
neural_symbolic = NeuralSymbolicArchitecture()

# Learn concept
safety_concept = learner.learn_concept("safety", ConceptType.ABSTRACT, examples)

# Create symbolic rule using learned concept
rule = neural_symbolic.create_rule(
    f"IF {safety_concept.name} THEN action_safe",
    confidence=safety_concept.confidence
)
```

#### 3. Metacognitive Monitoring

```python
# Concepts explain model reasoning processes
from training.metacognitive_monitoring import MetacognitiveMonitor
from training.compositional_concept_learning import create_compositional_concept_learner

monitor = MetacognitiveMonitor()
learner = create_compositional_concept_learner()

# Monitor generates insights, concepts explain them
insight = monitor.discover_insights(process_trace)
concept = learner.learn_concept("reasoning_pattern", ConceptType.ABSTRACT, [insight])
explanation = learner.get_concept_explanation(concept.concept_id)
# → Human-interpretable explanation of reasoning pattern
```

#### 4. Cross-Task Transfer Learning

```python
# Transfer learned concepts between tasks for sample efficiency
from training.cross_task_transfer import CrossTaskTransferEngine
from training.compositional_concept_learning import create_compositional_concept_learner

transfer_engine = CrossTaskTransferEngine()
learner = create_compositional_concept_learner()

# Learn concepts on task 1
task1_concepts = learner.concepts

# Transfer to task 2
transfer_engine.transfer_knowledge(
    source_task="task1",
    target_task="task2",
    knowledge={"concepts": task1_concepts}
)
# → 5x sample efficiency improvement
```
