## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'XXX'"

**Solution:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements-core.txt
```

### Problem: "Cannot find demo file"

**Solution:**

```bash
cd "/Users/zulhilmirahmat/Development/programming/Symbio AI"
ls examples/  # Verify demos exist
python examples/theorem_proving_demo.py
```

### Problem: Virtual environment not active

**Solution:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python --version  # Should show 3.11.x
which python      # Should show .venv/bin/python
```

### Problem: Demo shows warnings about GPU/Redis/PostgreSQL

**Solution:**
This is normal! These are optional features. Demos work fine without them.

### Problem: "Z3/Lean/Coq not found"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Z3 is already installed (z3-solver 4.12.2)
# Lean and Coq are optional system-level tools
# The system falls back gracefully if they're missing
```
