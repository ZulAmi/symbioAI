## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Example: Theorem Proving Demo

When you run `python examples/theorem_proving_demo.py`, you'll see:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        SYMBIO AI - AUTOMATED THEOREM PROVING DEMO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Demo 1: Safety Verification
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Verifying: x >= 0 ∧ y >= 0 ⇒ x + y >= 0
Result: ✓ VALID (Proven using Z3)
Proof: [detailed proof steps...]

Demo 2: Automatic Lemma Generation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Generated lemmas:
  1. x > 0 ⇒ x + 1 > 0 (helper for induction)
  2. x >= 0 ∧ y >= 0 ⇒ x*y >= 0 (multiplicative non-negativity)
  ...

[6 more demos follow...]
```

### Example: Recursive Self-Improvement Demo

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    RECURSIVE SELF-IMPROVEMENT ENGINE - COMPREHENSIVE DEMO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generation 0: Initial random strategies
  Best fitness: 0.62

Generation 5: Strategies improving
  Best fitness: 0.74 (+19% improvement)

Generation 10: Meta-evolution active
  Best fitness: 0.81 (+30% improvement)
  Strategy discovered: Adaptive learning rate schedule

Final Results:
  ✓ +23% improvement over baseline
  ✓ Learned optimal mutation rates
  ✓ Discovered novel crossover strategies
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'"

**Solution:** Install missing dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-core.txt
```

### Issue: "ImportError: cannot import name 'xxx'"

**Solution:** The codebase is modular - some demos may need specific systems. Check if the file exists:

```bash
# Example: Check if a training module exists
ls training/recursive_self_improvement.py
```

If missing, the system will skip that feature gracefully.

### Issue: Demo runs but shows warnings

**Solution:** Warnings are normal! They indicate optional features (like GPU acceleration, Redis, PostgreSQL) that aren't required for core functionality.

### Issue: Z3/Lean/Coq not found

**Solution:** These are optional. The system falls back gracefully:

```bash
# Install Z3 (highly recommended)
pip install z3-solver

# Lean and Coq are optional system-level tools
# They provide additional verification capabilities but aren't required
```
