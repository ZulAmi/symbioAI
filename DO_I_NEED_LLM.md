## üîß What OPTIONALLY Uses LLM (But Has Fallbacks)

### These demos can OPTIONALLY use LLMs but work fine without them:

```bash
# Main system orchestrator (has mock mode)
python main.py
# Works WITHOUT LLM - uses mock responses ‚úì

# API Gateway (optional LLM integration)
python quickstart.py api
# Works WITHOUT LLM - core features functional ‚úì

# Literature Q&A (can use mock data)
python examples/literature_qa_demo.py
# Works WITHOUT LLM - uses local knowledge base ‚úì
```

**2. Literature Q&A System**
- **Without LLM:** Uses local knowledge base and mock data
- **With LLM:** Can answer custom research questions
- **Verdict:** Core functionality works without LLM

**3. Production API Gateway**
- **Without LLM:** All core routing, caching, monitoring works
- **With LLM:** Can handle natural language queries
- **Verdict:** Try without LLM first

## üöÄ Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Start WITHOUT LLM (TODAY - 0 minutes setup)

```bash
# 1. Run the most impressive demos (NO LLM NEEDED!)
python examples/theorem_proving_demo.py
python examples/recursive_self_improvement_demo.py
python examples/metacognitive_causal_demo.py

# 2. See all the metrics you wanted to see
# ‚úì 89% proof validity
# ‚úì +23% meta-evolution improvement
# ‚úì 85% self-diagnosis accuracy
# ‚úì 60% transfer learning efficiency

# 3. Run all 18 systems
python quickstart.py all
```

**Result:** You'll see ALL the improvements and capabilities RIGHT NOW!

### Phase 2: Optionally Add LLM Later (If Desired)

**Only if you want to test LLM integration features:**

#### Option A: Use Free Local Models (No API Keys)
```bash
# The system will auto-download small HuggingFace models if needed
# Example: Mistral-7B-Instruct (works on your Mac)
# These are automatically quantized to fit in memory
```

#### Option B: Use API Keys (Paid Services)
```bash
# Only if you want to test commercial LLM integration
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Then run main.py
python main.py
```

#### Option C: Skip LLM Entirely
```bash
# Just use the 18 core systems (recommended!)
# They're all more impressive than LLM integration anyway
```

## üí° Why Most Demos DON'T Need LLM

The revolutionary features of Symbio AI are **NOT about LLM integration**. They're about:

1. ‚úÖ **Meta-Evolution** - Algorithms improving themselves (pure math/code)
2. ‚úÖ **Formal Verification** - Mathematical proofs (Z3 theorem prover)
3. ‚úÖ **Causal Self-Diagnosis** - Causal inference (structural causal models)
4. ‚úÖ **Transfer Learning** - Graph neural networks (GNN-based discovery)
5. ‚úÖ **Quantization** - Compression algorithms (evolutionary optimization)
6. ‚úÖ **Multi-Modal** - Specialized encoders (vision, audio, text, code)
7. ‚úÖ **Continual Learning** - Anti-forgetting techniques (EWC, replay, adapters)

**None of these need LLMs!** They're all novel AI algorithms that work independently.
