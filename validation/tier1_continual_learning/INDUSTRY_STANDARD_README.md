# Industry-Standard Continual Learning Benchmarks

**Research implementation following published best practices for continual/lifelong learning.**

## Overview

This implementation provides a **research-grade** continual learning benchmark suite with proper:

- ✅ CNN architectures (ResNet-18, SimpleCNN) instead of MLPs
- ✅ Literature-standard hyperparameters (EWC λ = 400, not 5000)
- ✅ Train/validation/test splits with early stopping
- ✅ Model checkpointing for best validation performance
- ✅ TensorBoard experiment tracking
- ✅ Reproducible evaluation with seed setting
- ✅ YAML configuration management

## What This Implementation Is

### ✅ Suitable For:

- **Research prototyping**: Quick experimentation with continual learning methods
- **Educational purposes**: Learning continual learning concepts and implementations
- **Benchmark comparisons**: Comparing against other methods on standard datasets
- **Ablation studies**: Testing different components and hyperparameters

### ❌ NOT Suitable For (Without Modification):

- **Production deployment**: Requires distributed training, monitoring, serving infrastructure
- **Large-scale datasets**: Currently designed for MNIST, CIFAR-10 (not ImageNet, MS-COCO)
- **State-of-the-art claims**: Performance is good but not SOTA without further tuning
- **Direct comparison to Google/Meta**: They use proprietary techniques, multi-GPU setups, much larger models

## Features

### Architecture

- **ResNet-18 backbone**: Proper convolutional architecture for image data
- **SimpleCNN option**: Lighter network for faster experimentation
- **Multi-head architecture**: Separate output heads per task to prevent interference

### Continual Learning Methods

1. **Naive**: No continual learning (baseline, expect catastrophic forgetting)
2. **Experience Replay**: Reservoir sampling with balanced replay across tasks
3. **EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)**: Fisher Information-based regularization (λ = 400)
4. **Multi-head**: Task-specific output heads
5. **Optimized**: Combines replay + EWC + knowledge distillation

### Training Infrastructure

- **Validation splits**: 15% of training data for validation
- **Early stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience=5 epochs
- **Checkpointing**: Saves best model based on validation accuracy
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Cosine annealing
- **Gradient clipping**: Stability with max_norm=1.0
- **TensorBoard logging**: Track metrics in real-time

### Evaluation Metrics (Standard in Literature)

- **Average Accuracy**: Mean accuracy across all tasks
- **Forgetting Measure**: Average drop in accuracy from peak
- **Forward Transfer**: Performance on new tasks compared to random baseline
- **Backward Transfer**: Change in previous task performance
- **Task Retention**: Ratio of final to initial accuracy per task

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision tensorboard pyyaml numpy

# Or use requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Run with Default Configuration

```bash
# Run on MNIST with optimized strategy
python industry_standard_benchmarks.py --dataset mnist --strategy optimized

# Run on CIFAR-10 with replay only
python industry_standard_benchmarks.py --dataset cifar10 --strategy replay
```

### 2. Customize via Config File

Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  architecture: "resnet18" # or "simple_cnn"
  feature_dim: 512

training:
  learning_rate: 0.001
  epochs_per_task: 20
  batch_size: 128

continual_learning:
  strategy: "optimized"
  ewc_lambda: 400 # Literature standard
  replay_buffer_size: 2000
```

Then run:

```bash
python industry_standard_benchmarks.py --dataset cifar10 --config config.yaml
```

### 3. Monitor with TensorBoard

```bash
# In another terminal
tensorboard --logdir=./runs

# Open http://localhost:6006 in browser
```

- **`simple_cnn`**: 2M parameters, faster training, good for MNIST

## Expected Performance

### Realistic Expectations (Based on Literature)

| Dataset  | Strategy  | Expected Avg Acc | Expected Forgetting |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| MNIST    | Naive     | 0.75-0.80        | 0.40-0.50           |
| MNIST    | Replay    | 0.90-0.95        | 0.05-0.15           |
| MNIST    | EWC       | 0.85-0.90        | 0.10-0.20           |
| MNIST    | Optimized | 0.92-0.97        | 0.03-0.10           |
| CIFAR-10 | Naive     | 0.40-0.50        | 0.50-0.60           |
| CIFAR-10 | Replay    | 0.70-0.80        | 0.15-0.25           |
| CIFAR-10 | EWC       | 0.65-0.75        | 0.20-0.30           |
| CIFAR-10 | Optimized | 0.75-0.85        | 0.10-0.20           |

**Note**: These are with 5 tasks, 20 epochs per task. SOTA methods achieve higher but require more training.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this production-ready?

**A**: No. This is a research implementation. Production requires distributed training, proper serving infrastructure, monitoring, and testing at scale.

### Q: Can I publish papers with this?

**A**: Yes, for workshop papers and preliminary results. For top-tier conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR), you'll need to add more sophisticated techniques and scale to larger datasets.

### Q: How does this compare to published results?

**A**: Performance is competitive with baseline methods but not SOTA. Published papers often have additional tricks, longer training, and dataset-specific tuning.

### Q: What's the main limitation?

**A**: Scale. This runs on single GPU with small datasets. Real-world applications need multi-GPU training and larger models.

### Q: Should I use this for my startup?

**A**: As a starting point for prototyping, yes. For production, you'll need to add infrastructure, monitoring, and scale up the architecture.
