## What to Expect

### CIFAR-10 (Current)

- **10 classes** of natural images (airplane, car, bird, cat, etc.)
- **Harder than MNIST** - requires learning visual features
- **Realistic test** of continual learning capabilities
- **Goal:** >80% accuracy, <15% forgetting for "GOOD" rating

### CIFAR-100 (Critical)

- **100 classes** in 5 superclasses
- **THE KEY BENCHMARK** for research papers
- Universities will focus on this result
- **Goal:** >70% accuracy, <20% forgetting for university collaboration

### TinyImageNet-200 (Production)

- **200 classes** of 64×64 images
- **Production-scale** complexity
- Shows system scales beyond toy problems
- **Goal:** >60% accuracy, <25% forgetting for credibility

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Analyze results** - Compare to published baselines
2. **Create comparison table** - Your results vs. DER++, REMIND, Co2L
3. **Write 2-page summary** - For university professors
4. **Prepare presentation** - 20-30 slides (Japanese + English)
5. **Email professors** - Target 3-5 at Kyushu U, Fukuoka U, KIT
